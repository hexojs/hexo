This is #2 in the saga of finding a good Bluetooth keyboard for tablet convenience! My previous blog outlined a great and inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard and case i ordered from amazon! I loved it! BUT, 2-3 months into using the item, the ENTIRE center row of keys just stopped working! No physical damage, no water damage, nothing to trigger the malfunction. I tried a few of the “typical problems” from google with keyboards like this, yet nothing fixed it! But i digress, i ordered what i feel will be my new 5 star purchase!

This new compact keyboard i decided on is, of course Bluetooth as well. I want the perfect compact keyboard to use with my iPad, I’m on the road a lot for work and i use my iPad ALOT. This new purchase is super nice because its compact and folds together to be even smaller when not in use. Yes, it was nice that the last keyboard also came with a case, and the case fit the keyboard and it all folded up together, but this is a whole new venture,

### **This keyboard is the exact same width as the last one (a smidge less then 10inches) but about 2 inches shorter. So i can still utilize the case from my previous purchase if i so chose.**

So far this thing is proving itself to quite the badass piece of machinery!! One HUGE feature it has that the other keyboards DONT have is, it can pair to 3 different units!!! Which is HUGE for me. When I’m in my truck i turn it on to setting one (the iPad) when I’m at my office at home i turn it on to either setting 2 or 3 (2 = MacBook, 3 = raspberry pi). Such a massive convenience!
