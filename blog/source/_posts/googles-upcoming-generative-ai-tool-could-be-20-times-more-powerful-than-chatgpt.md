A semiconductor research company, SemiAnalysis, has reported that Google's upcoming generative AI tool, Gemini, is currently five times more powerful than the most advanced GPT-4 models on the market. The company predicts that Gemini could be as much as 20 times more powerful than ChatGPT by the end of 2024.

SemiAnalysis's report comes after Google appeared to be lagging behind other tech giants in the development of generative AI tools. However, the company has recently made significant investments in AI, and the release of Gemini is seen as a sign that Google is now taking the lead in this area.

The Center for AI Safety, a research group that studies the potential risks of artificial intelligence, said that Google's investment in Gemini is "no surprise" given the company's "tremendous financial resources." The center also warned that the spread of generative AI could pose a threat to human life, and that it is important to develop safety measures to mitigate these risks.

The development of generative AI has also prompted governments to take action. China has made moves to regulate its AI businesses, while the British government is to host an "AI safety summit" in November. The United States Senate is also planning to host a series of meetings on AI safety, with the first meeting scheduled for September 13.

The development of generative AI is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important to be aware of the potential risks and benefits of this technology. By working together, governments, businesses, and researchers can help to ensure that generative AI is used for good.
