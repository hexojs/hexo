I had the idea for a latern for a while, a couple years ago (ok i might be abit of a pack rat) a buddy gave me 2 really cool looking hanging lanterns.  he was just going to throw them away so i took them and stashed them until the right time, and the right time came.  I was browing at walmart and found an light bulb that is supposed to suplicate the looks of an actual fire.  While staying within my realm (lol) seeing as it was $7, i snatched it so i could make a blog about it!

This project was fairly simple, i just drilled a hole in the top of the lantern in which i ran the wires up a chain i had laying around… the power wire i intertwined within the chain and sent that on up thru the ceiling.

After fishing the wire out of the celiing i grabbed one of my handy dandy "Sonoff Wifi Switch's" ($9) and set that up to power its actions.

And after all was said and done, as far as a the operational test #1, im happy with the turnout!!!!
