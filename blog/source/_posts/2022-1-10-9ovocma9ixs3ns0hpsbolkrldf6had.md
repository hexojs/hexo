So this lil story has a little backing to it. This woman started texting me on Facebook messenger, of course first thing I did was check her profile. SHOCKER, she didnt have a Facebook profile she just had messenger. Of course I asked her about it and there were the excuses, blah blah. At this particular time in my timeline, I was in florida working, and I was out there alone, so having somebody to bullshit with wasn’t a bad thing. I was sure the person was fake, but didnt really pry. Long story short, chatted with her/him/it for a few weeks then lost interest. She recently started hitting me up again and now that I had a little more leisurely time on my hands I figured I would solve this damn puzzle. So I started off with, “hey lets video chat” … excuse excuse excuse…. So now its grind time.

**Backstory, when I was in florida she lived in florida, months later now she live in New Jersey, and she works at a Orphanage (cmon now)** She would always call me “babe” (not sure why) so I started what I call the “bait questions” , in order to bait them into a reply or something in which im trying ti place them. So I asked if she likes movies, of course she answered yes. Then joked around about like most girls im sure she can never pick a movie, she agreed.

That was the setup, I recent found a pretty cool website that helps couples pick a movie, haven’t used it yet but was very intrigued. The man picks a movie and the girl picks one and it finds one with the likeness of both blah blah blah, thats not the point. The point is im trying to setup a legitimate reason to get her in my playing field…

Ill explain for those who dont know, there is a process called “IP logging” or “URL IP Logging” and its very simple. What it does is this Im sure everybody has seen “url shortening links” like when you see a google link that looks like goo.gl.hdye748 or something of that nature, thats just google shortening the link for whatever reason, aesthetics or whatever. Well now you can do that same process but also embed a code in that newly made URL that will track whoever clicks its IP address.

# **The Process:**

1\. You pick a website (a real website) , remember should be something intriguing that will make sure they click it

2\. Goto any IP Logging URL shortener

3\. Plug in the Bait url and this is Very important, when its shortening the url it’ll give you options as to what the “disguised url” will come out as, now you can just makeup whatever you want you have to look at which ones they offer, thats why I chose the URL for the movie thing , because one of the disguised URLs they offered was dating.club, I felt that was hidden enough not to second guess it

4\. After you made your link, keep on with your story. Paste the link and wait for your logger to tell you the info. So long story short, here is the OUTCOME! She/he/it/her/him/them/hey/demon/ fuck you and your pronouns

…..Lives in Nigeria, and i was able to obtain quite a bit of info!
