# Thors Hammer

I think the title speaks for itself, THORS HAMMERS!!!

Thor’s Hammer was known as the **Mjölnir**. In Norse mythology, hardly could any weapon surpass the _Mjölnir_ regarding reputation or power. Indeed, **Thor** hammer was considered to be the best weapon in the myth. Because not only did it help defend the Gods, but it also gave the blessing. However, most of the times what we know about _Mjölnir_ was its presence with Thor in combat. And for sure, we barely know anything about its origin. This blog post will briefly and precisely discuss the origin of this outstanding _Mjölnir_ .
