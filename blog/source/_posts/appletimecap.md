# Converting old tech, into a new NAS

Im a pretty big cheapskate. With that being said, i ALWAYS try to find cheaper “work arounds” for solutions to problems. Especially tech problems, there is always a cheaper way. My current situation, i have a 6ft projector screen in my living room that i love, powered by a raspberry pi, that pulls from my media server that is upstairs. Media server is an old PC with 350gb HDD and a 1TB external for movie storage, both in which i depleted. So now i need more memory. and i want it cheap. i found an Apple Time Capsule on OfferUp for $30. These were discontinued years back because they just didn’t take. but they to have a 2 TB HDD integrated. So after hours spend trying to make the apple networking drive work seamlessly with ANY other OS, i made no progress. so next answer was to start taking things apart. this video will show you how to remove the HDD from an Apple Time Capsule and make it usable. My apologies my camera died before completion . but the removal is laid out here, and its pretty self explanatory after that!
