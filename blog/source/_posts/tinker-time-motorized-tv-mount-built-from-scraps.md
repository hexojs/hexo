The journey of making a motorized TV mount, after I saw something on an old episode of MTV cribs, I tried to make my own version with garage parts….

I saw a show where the main character had a tv that was hidden behind a dresser, and when he pressed his remote it would appear from behind it, I thought it was so cool! After looking online to see how much it was I was astonished at the price they were charging, so what now? Time to Build it!!

I started with the test build, pretty much just building it for functionality, wont be pretty, but it needs to work. The first iteration of this was built with scrap 1x2’s, some metal gear/wheels I found in my garage and some belts for said gears.

After the first iteration worked, I notated what I wanted to do for the final product and that consisted of

Make it less noisy, I used an old RC car motor to power it, it did work, but was a bit louder then id like

Program the compatibility for Alexa/Google Home

After long hours of getting those completed, I was left with exactly what I wanted

## This is the final product!!!
