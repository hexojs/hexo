Over the weekend, I decided to do some thrift shopping and I struck gold at one of the stores. I found an antique Bell & Howell 122 LR 8mm projector in perfect condition. As an enthusiast of most antique and modern tech, I was ecstatic to find such a treasure. Not to mention, this is go well with my other Bell & Howell

The Bell & Howell 122 LR 8mm projector was first manufactured in the 1940s and was a popular choice for home movie projection. The 8mm film format was introduced in the 1930s as a cheaper alternative to the more expensive 16mm format. The Bell & Howell 122 LR was one of the most advanced 8mm projectors of its time, featuring a built-in light source and a variable speed motor.

The projector I found is in excellent condition, with all of its original parts and hardware. It even came with the original manual and carrying case. It's a rare find, especially in such good condition. The projector can still be used today to play 8mm films, which can be a great way to enjoy vintage home movies or classic films.

Overall, I couldn't be more thrilled with my find. The Bell & Howell 122 LR 8mm projector is not only a beautiful piece of film history, but it also has the potential to bring a lot of joy to those who love vintage film. It's amazing what you can find when you take the time to explore thrift stores. I encourage everyone to keep an open mind when thrift shopping, you never know what treasures you might come across.
