Purchased iPad keyboard and case from Amazon, like always came in with the quickness. I absolutly love this purchase. Anyone who actively dislikes tap-typing onscreen will appreciate the convenience and comfort of a keyboard case. It helps you type quickly and accurately on your lap, as you do with a laptop, and it’s especially useful if you type often. When your keyboard doubles as a cover (and the cover, once closed automatically triggers the lockscreen) , you always have it with you. If you prefer a keyboard for your iPad, consider the trade-off between a keyboard case’s extra bulk and weight against the typing experience and the extra expense. A keyboard case should not be too big or small, with keys that comfortably travel and without weird, unconventional layouts. Please note that keyboard cases are specific to iPad models and that the expense of a keyboard case may not be transferrable to a new iPad you buy in the future.

Choosing which keyboard case to buy should prompt you to also consider features like iPad function keys like Spotlight search, brightness, home, multiple angle options, an easy on-off design, flexibility to disengage it from the cover when it’s not needed, and long battery life. I personally didnt notice any difference in battery life, im thinking because the minimal strain on the battery for having the Bluetooth enabled, was far less then HOW MUCH LONGER IT TOOK ME TO TYPE WITHOUT THIS KEYBOARD!!!!

End Result : I love this purchase

If you appreciated this review, and decide to purcahse, please be a team player and purchase from my amazon link!!

UPDATE: Well after 3 months of loving this thing, one day out of nowhere the keyboard took a turn for the worse. There wasn’t any physical damage done, or any other kind of damage for that matter, just one day the entire middle row of keys stopped working. I attempted random keyboard repairs techniques from google, and none of them turned up anything, so now I have a bricked mini keyboard that does no good with 1/3 of the keys not working. So my review of this particular item clearly dropped several notches, I’m not sure I’d recommend this item. Maybe i just got the lemon, but who knows. I still use the case, so thats a plus.
