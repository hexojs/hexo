# Affordable Home Automation #3

## Flashing firmware on hardware

I set out to develop a way to automate my home, but to so it affordable. The bid I received was $4,750 for the features I wanted, I just knew I could get it done for cheaper, and I did! I’ll start with step one : finding home automation parts on sale, regardless of brand. All affordable home automation pieces are typically “brand specific”, meaning that brand is specific to its own mobile all and they are not I interchangeable, unless you can Re flash the native firmware, which I’ll walk you through.

I decided to purchase some “Sonoff” hardware that was on sale for super cheap, roughly $6 per wifi switch, which is a huge part of running most things. I got wifi switches, touch panel light switches, RF and IR bridges and so on. But not all brands matched so I had to flash accordingly. A firmware brand called “Tasmota” is compatible with my Samsung Smartthings so I decided on that. One tool needed is the flashing chip, there are a couple different models, which enables you to flash the hardware.
