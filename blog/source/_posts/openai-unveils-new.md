It seems like OpenAI is not only breaking new grounds in AI but also in humor! In a delightful twist, amidst the rollercoaster of executive shake-ups, they've rolled out a nifty new feature for ChatGPT – and it's free! Yes, you read that right. The voice feature, previously a premium perk, is now available to all ChatGPT users at no cost.

### Chatting with ChatGPT Just Got Easier (and Free!)

Remember the times when you had to type out your queries to ChatGPT? Those days are over!

This feature was initially introduced in September but was exclusive to the paying crowd. Now, it's a free-for-all party!

It's a sly nod to the recent turmoil where most employees threatened to quit unless the entire board steps down.

Greg Brockman, former OpenAI president who resigned following Altman's exit, chimed in on X. He encouraged everyone to try the new feature, hinting at a possible return to OpenAI, as reported by The Verge.
