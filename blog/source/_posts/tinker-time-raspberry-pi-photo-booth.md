I was chit chatting with my brother and he was telling me a story about the Photo Booth he had rented for his daughters birthday party, how much fun they had, and how much everybody loved it.  His mind, as always, will begin thinking, could this be made lucrative?  he mentioned how much the rental was, i forget what that figure was now, but if i were to guess, probably around the $500 range for a full evening..?  but in order to purchase a machine yourself i think he said around $1,800, ive also looked up a couple myself and see the anywhere from $1,800-$3,600.

So of course this would promt me to turn the gears in my bring to devise a cheaper alternative, being a tech, gadget, programmer, and raspberry pi addict, knew it would be done for pennies on the dollar. So i started with Github, of course.

i knew i had all the parts needed, so it wasnt that big of a process. 3 hours later, i had a completed adapt of a Photo Booth!  of course i didnt care enough to build the whole "booth" part, although if for some reason, i found a wild up my arse, that wouldnt be an issue either, i would just be driving myself crazy for a few days deciding how i would want to design it.  but anywhoo.....

The Raspberry Pi is the heart of the booth,

currently the photos are being snapped with a PiCam, which can be switched for damn near any ofther camera with the proper programming modifications.  but i feel the PiCam Is not only adequate for this but maybe ever over powered.

Ive got 2 basic/analog push buttons, running through a breadboard.  The two button control the main features of the booth.  Blue Button starts the picture taking process (after you choose if you want to take 1 or 4) and the red button (after pics are taken) will send the image to your local wifi enabled printer to autoatically print
