I have been working on the “Smart Mirror” for a few months now, Already have smart mirrors ready to go, which is a really cool addition to any home (see pictures) but i am now trying to merge the smart home hub into the programming so it could serve more then one purpose. it may not be completed yet, but it is close!! stay tuned!
