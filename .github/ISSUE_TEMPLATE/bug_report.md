<!-- NOTE:

A good bug report should have your configuration and build environment information, which are essential for us to investigate the problem. We've provided the following steps on how to attach the necessary information.

If you find that markdown files are not rendered as expected, please go to https://marked.js.org/demo/ to see if it can be reproduced there. If it can be reproduced, please file a bug to https://github.com/markedjs/marked.

If you want help on your bug, please also send us the git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket etc...) where your hexo code is stored. It would greatly help. If you prefer not to have your hexo code out in public, please upload to a private GitHub repository and grant read-only access to hexojs/core.

Please take extra precaution not to attach any secret environment variables (likes password or GitHub Personal Access Token).

## How to reproduce?

* Step1

## Is the problem still there under "Safe mode"?

<!--
https://hexo.io/docs/commands#Safe-mode

"Safe mode" will disable all the plugins and scripts.
If your problem disappear under "Safe mode" means the problem is probably at your newly installed plugins, not at hexo.
