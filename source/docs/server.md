## Express

To start server, run the following command:

``` bash
$ hexo server
```

Your website will running at `http://localhost:4000`. You can edit the server port in `_config.yml` or use flags to override the default port. For example:

``` bash
$ hexo server -p 5000
```

Server will watch for file changes and update automatically. However, server won't update files in `public` folder. You should run `hexo generate` instead.

{% note info Restart Hexo after configuration changed %}
Hexo doesn't watch for configuration file changes. You have to restart Hexo to make the new configurations take effects.
{% endnote %}

### Static Mode

In static mode, only files in `public` folder will be served and file watching is disabled. You have to run `hexo generate` before starting the server. Usually used in production.

``` bash
$ hexo server -s
```

### Logger

To log requests of server, you can enable logger in `_config.yml`. Logger is always enabled in debug mode.

``` yaml
logger: true
logger_format: default
```

Or use flags to override default settings. For example:

``` bash
$ hexo server -l default
```

`default` | :remote-addr - - [:date] ":method :url HTTP/:http-version" :status :res[content-length] ":referrer" ":user-agent"
`short` | :remote-addr - :method :url HTTP/:http-version :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms
`tiny` | :method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms
